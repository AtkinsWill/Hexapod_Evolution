How to run the evolving hexapod simulation:

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Method 1 - run the program as a .exe
!!!!! .exe can be supplied as a zip from a OneDrive link

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: Windows OS

Tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

0. Gain access to the "Hexapod_Build.zip" directory which is not found on the Github.
1. Extract the contents of the zip.
2. Navigate to "Hexapod_Build"
3. Run "Evolving Heaxpod.exe"

See the UI section for how to use the interface.
Max and Mean fitness data for each iteration can be found in "Hexapod_Build/CSVdataOutput/fitnesses.csv"



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Method 2 - run the program through Unity 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: Windows OS, Unity Hub 

Tested and working with:
Windows 10
Unity Hub v3.4.1

Using the UI
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The menu has a button to start the simulation and 6 inputs.
The simulation is loaded with preset values so you can press "Run Evolution" immediately.

The top 3 boxes are decimal inputs that will limit any input greater than 1 to 1.
Population size and Seed are integers. Duration can be a decimal input.
When ready, click "Run Evolution". 
There are no more UI elements. Data is outputted to a csv file located in the directories specified in each method.

We found results would show after 250 iterations.

Preset values:

Crossover rate: 0.3
Mutation rate: 0.4
Mutation Amount: 0.5
Population: 10
Seed: 12
Duration: 10
